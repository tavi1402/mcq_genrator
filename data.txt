Generative artificial intelligence (generative AI, GAI, or GenAI[1]) is artificial intelligence capable of generating text, images, synthetic data, or other media, using generative models.[2][3][4] Generative AI models learn the patterns and structure of their input training data and then generate new data that has similar characteristics.[5][6]

In the ongoing AI boom, advances in transformer-based deep neural networks have enabled a number of generative AI systems notable for accepting natural language prompts as input. These include large language model (LLM) chatbots such as ChatGPT, Copilot, Bard, and LLaMA, and text-to-image artificial intelligence art systems such as Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and DALL-E.[7][8][9] Additionally, this has lead to a surge in investment in generative AI, with large companies such as Microsoft, Google, and Baidu as well as numerous smaller firms developing generative AI models.[2][10][11]

Generative AI has uses across a wide range of industries, including art, writing, script writing, software development, product design, healthcare, finance, gaming, marketing, and fashion.[12][13][14] However, there are also concerns about the potential misuse of generative AI, including cybercrime, the creation fake news, or the production of deepfakes that can be used to deceive or manipulate people.[15][16]
